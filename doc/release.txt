Checklist for releasing OpenGrok:
---------------------------------

../ext_lib - is a directory where we keep latest JFlex.jar and all necessary
jars/dirs for tests

0) set proper version in build.xml

   <property name="version" value="???"/>

   and put some stuff into CHANGES.txt

   Then commit the change:

     git commit

1) build must be clean

   ant clean
   ant # defaults to jar currently

2) check all tests, tests code coverage:
   junit, pmd, findbugs, checkstyle, emma, jdepend

They should be ok, currently only checkstyle has 8 warnings, the rest is
clean; emma reports should be based according to what is set for the release,
usually it's overall coverage above 80%)

(jenkins can help here, see README.txt on setup)

3) tag the build used for release so we can get back to it:

   git tag 0.XYZ
   git push origin --tags

4) produce proper distributions

Check them before upload, always try to build on Solaris, since gnu tar might
create a non-standard compliant .tgz version and tag from step 0) will be used
to produce the archive

  ant dist
  ant package

5) Upload them using https://github.com/OpenGrok/OpenGrok/releases

The release is OK, once above is fullfilled to our satisfaction.
